Design Doc Project 1

Project Overview: Creating a playable sudoku game. This game will have an interface that will allow the user to select squares and click buttons to input numbers onto the board. Users will have the option to have auto check on or off.
-	Auto check on: Once a user ‘enters’ a number into a spot, if that number is incorrect, then the square will turn red to reflect an incorrect selection. 
-	Auto check off: Once a user has ‘entered’ all numbers (i.e. the board is full), they can then check all of their guesses to see whether the board has been correctly solved or not. 
The rules for Sudoku will match the normal rules for the game. There will be a nine by nine grid separated into nine boxes that are three by three. There will be one set of numbers from one through nine in each row, column, and three by three square.

Tools to Use: Python (with Pygame)
-	Python will be used to for the entire algorithm
-	Pygame will be specifically used to create the GUI for the visual aspect of the game
