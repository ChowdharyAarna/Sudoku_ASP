Run the gui.py file. You may need to install pygame if you haven't already. 

The instructions to play my game will print in the terminal after running gui.py however I have also copied this instructions below!

Rules
_____________________________
The rules are as any other Sudoku game, the numbers used on the board are 
the integers from 1 to 9. In each row, column, and three by three square, there 
must be one and only one occurance of each of these integers.
 
How to Play
_____________________________
All of the white numbers on the board are the starting numbers [they are fixed].
Start by clicking on any empty cell on the board. The cell borders will turn 
blue to indicate this selection. From here, you can either click on of the number
buttons on the right to enter that number, or click the same cell again to 
deselect. Autocheck is enabled so the cell borders will either turn red to indicate
an incorrect entry, or stay the same color if it is correct. Keep entering numbers utill
the board is completed! Have fun!
